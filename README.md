# RAG Voice Agent

A sophisticated voice-enabled AI assistant that combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with speech capabilities to provide intelligent, context-aware responses through both voice and text interactions.

## üåü Key Features

- **Voice Interaction**: Seamless voice input and output using advanced ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) models
- **RAG-Powered Knowledge Base**: Intelligent document retrieval and response generation using vector database technology
- **Multi-Modal Interface**: Supports both voice and text-based interactions
- **Web Search Integration**: Capability to search the internet for up-to-date information
- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains context through conversation history
- **Extensible Tool System**: Modular architecture with support for adding new tools and capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **ASR Model**: Faster Whisper (Medium variant) for accurate speech recognition
- **Embedding Model**: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for document embeddings
- **LLM**: TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat for response generation
- **TTS Model**: Glow-TTS for natural speech synthesis
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant for efficient similarity search
- **Web Search**: DuckDuckGo integration for real-time information

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

1. **VoiceRAGAgent**: Core agent class that orchestrates all components and manages the interaction flow
2. **AudioHandler**: Manages voice input/output, including recording and speech synthesis
3. **TaskHandler**: Processes user queries and determines appropriate actions
4. **ComponentInitializer**: Handles initialization of all AI models and components
5. **Tools**: Modular system including:
   - SearchDocumentsTool: RAG knowledge base search
   - WebSearchTool: Internet search capability
   - SaveNoteTool: Note-taking functionality
